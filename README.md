# 🌾 Crop Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project leverages deep learning to detect crop diseases from leaf images, aiming to assist farmers and agronomists in early diagnosis and treatment. It uses transfer learning on the PlantVillage dataset and is deployable as a web or mobile application.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Classify multiple crop diseases using image data.
- Provide real-time predictions via a user-friendly interface.
- Improve agricultural productivity through early disease detection.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: ResNet50V2 (pretrained on ImageNet)
- **Technique**: Transfer Learning
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Accuracy**: ~94% on test data

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source**: [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- **Classes**: 39 crop disease categories
- **Format**: RGB leaf images

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time image classification
- Data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip)
- Early stopping and dropout regularization
- Web interface for image upload and prediction
